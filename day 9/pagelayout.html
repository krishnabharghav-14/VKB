            <p>Uppalapati Venkata Suryanarayana Prabhas Raju ([pɾabʱaːs] born 23 October 1979), known mononymously as Prabhas, is an Indian actor who works predominantly in Telugu cinema.[4] One of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema,[5] Prabhas has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2015[6][7][8] and has received seven Filmfare Awards nominations, a Nandi Award, and a SIIMA Award. Prabhas is referred to in the media as the "Rebel Star" and "Darling".[9]</p>
            <p>Prabhas made his acting debut with the 2002 drama Eeswar, and later attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). His notable works include Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lattermost.[10][11]</p>
            <p>In 2015, Prabhas portrayed the title role in S. S. Rajamouli's action film Baahubali: The Beginning and reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017). The latter emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film at that point, establishing him as the first pan-Indian star.[12][13][14] Commercial success has since varied, with the action thrillers Saaho (2019) and Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023) emerging among his biggest grossers.</p>
